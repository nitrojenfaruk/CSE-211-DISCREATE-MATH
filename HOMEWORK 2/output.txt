n
(a,a)(a,b)(a,e)(b,b)(b,e)(c,c)(c,d)(d,d)(e,e)
Reflexive: Yes, all elements are present.
Symmetric: No, (b,a) is not found where (a,b) is found.
Antisymmetric: Yes, (d,c) is not found where (c,d) is found and all other values adapt this rule.
Transitive: Yes, (c,d) is found where (c,d) and (d,d) are found.

Reflexive: Yes, all elements are present.
Symmetric: Yes, because all values are reflexive.
Asymmetric: Yes, because all values are reflexive.
Transitive: Yes, because all values are reflexive.
